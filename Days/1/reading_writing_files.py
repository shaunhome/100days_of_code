"""

Mode	Meaning
"r"	    Read (default, error if file doesnâ€™t exist)
"w"	    Write (creates file, overwrites existing content)
"a"	    Append (creates file if missing, adds to existing content)
"x"	    Exclusive creation (errors if file exists)
"r+"	Read & write (file must exist)
"w+"	Read & write (overwrites file)
"a+"	Read & append (creates if missing)

Look at Pandas, Install node and do the same code for javascript
